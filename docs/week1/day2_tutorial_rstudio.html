    <h6><a id="about"></a>Getting started with R and RStudio</h6>
    <h7><a id="about"></a>What is R?</h7> <br>
    <p>R is a freely available language and environment for statistical computing and graphics which provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques: linear and nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering, etc. <br></p>

    <h7><a id="about"></a>Download R from CRAN</h7> <br>
    <p>CRAN is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R. It is suggested to use the CRAN mirror nearest to you to minimize network load.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>View the list of mirrors by navigating to <a class="intext" href="https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html</a></li>
        <li>Once you select the mirror nearest to you, you should be presented with a page (see below) that has links to download R for your specific operating system. <br>
            <br><img width="710" alt="Links to download R" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54687845/210781131-83ea51a4-7dcf-4ffb-9b32-2ca78a4df3e6.png"><br>
        </li>
        <li>Choose the appropriate link and follow the provided instructions to download the R for your operating system. <br></li>
    </ol>


    <h7><a id="about"></a>What is RStudio?</h7> <br>
    <p>The RStudio integrated development environment (IDE) is a set of tools built to help you be more productive with R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution. It also features tools for plotting, viewing history, debugging and managing your workspace. <br></p>

    <h7><a id="about"></a>Download RStudio</h7> <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to <a class="intext" href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/">https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/</a>.</li>
        <li>Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system and install RStudio.</li>
    </ol>

    <h7><a id="about"></a>Utilizing RStudio</h7> <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Once you open the RStudio application on your machine, you can utilize the version of R that you downloaded by using the &quot;Console&quot;. Here you can run a single line of code and have the result be returned. <br>
            <br><img width="779" alt="R Console screenshot" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54687845/210785387-67a92c98-384d-4a6b-a001-efcf1d5e6933.png"><br>
        </li>
        <li>To become familiarized with R programming syntax, please try out the interactive primer found at <a class="intext" href="https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/1.2">https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/1.2</a> to learn the programming basics. <br></li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>One value of RStudio is that you can view and edit R scripts in the same window as running code in the console. R scripts are how you can save lines of code in a file to run in the future. R scripts have the naming syntax "filename.R" when saved. Practice creating and saving R scripts onto your local machine by utilizing the icons at the top left. <br></p>
