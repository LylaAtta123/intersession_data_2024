    <ul>
        <li>Intros: name, year, major, interests (academic and non-academic), why we're taking this class</li>
        <li>Class outine:
            <ul>
                <li>Format: this class will be fully virtual. Zoom link will be emailed to registered students.</li>
                <li>Session structure: each session will be structured as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Section 1 (50 min): Content (e.g. data visualization theory, critique of data visualization)</li>
                        <li>BREAK (10 min)</li>
                        <li>Section 2 (50 min): Practice (e.g. data sourcing, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization)</li>
                        <li>BREAK (10 min)</li>
                        <li>Section 3: Prep for next session (misc)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Expectations:
                    <ul>
                        <li>In this course, we will be discussing and critiquing data analyses and visualizations (our own, our peers', and public). It's important to keep in mind the time and effort that went into creating these pieces. While both positive and negative feedback is important to improving, it is important to constrain critiques to the piece at hand and refrain from criticisms directed at the authors' person. In general, assuming authors' best intentions is a good approach to keep in mind when offering feedback.</li>
                        <li>Class time will be allotted to work on data analysis and visualization exercises and on the class project. We do not expect you to dedicate any out of class time to complete assignments. If you feel like you are having trouble completing exercises during class time, please reach out to one of the instructors, so we can work together to find a solution.</li>
                        <li>We do not expect you to have any prior coding experience. We will be primarily working in the R programming language, but feel free to work in any other language you may be comfortable with.</li>
                        <li>This class relies heavily on interactive discussions as we evaluate data analyses and visualizations. We hope that the class environment feels safe and encouraging for everyone to feel comfortable participating. If for any reason this is not the case, please reach out to the instructors so we can work together to address any reasons this is not the case and/or find alternative ways to engage with the class content that ensures that you are able to get the most out of the class.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>In class exercises: individual exercises to learn/practice specific data analysis or visualization skills</li>
                        <li>Group project: tell a story using data on a topic you are interested in. Presentations in the final class sessions. Group sizes and presentation length TBD based on final number of students</li>
